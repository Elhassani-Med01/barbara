**How It Works:**

1. **Data Extraction:** The tool uses **LLama 3.3**, a state-of-the-art language model, to parse and extract key sections of a CV, such as:
   - Personal Information
   - Education
   - Work Experience
   - Skills
   - Certifications
   - Interests

2. **Standardization:**
   The extracted data is then reorganized into a predefined structure. The AI model ensures that all necessary information is captured and placed in the appropriate sections of the standardized CV.

3. **LaTeX Formatting:**
   The standardized CV is generated as a LaTeX document, providing a clean and professional layout. Users can further edit the LaTeX file if needed.

4. **Output Delivery:**
   Users can download the finalized CV in LaTeX or as a PDF.
